How project saving is going to be managed:
Create/Publish:
    Local:
        press create button in home page
        add project to /map<id, {title, map, cam}> projects/ (id like "local-1", "local-2")
    Server:
        press publish button in settings
        add project to /projects <id, title>/ (id serial)
        add project tilemap to /maps <id, map>/ (map json)
        rebind old id to new id on local and redirect

Get list:
    Get projects from server then add unique ones from local

Save:
    Local:
        wait 5 seconds after editing
        save project to projects
    Server:
        press save button in settings
        save project name to projects
        save project map to maps
